To integrate BTCPay Server into an existing WooCommerce store, follow the steps below or check our official [installation instructions](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/WooCommerce/).

### 1. Deploy BTCPay Server (optional) ###

This step is optional, if you already have a BTCPay Server instance setup you can skip to section 2. below. To launch your BTCPay server, you can self-host it, or use a third party host.

#### 1.1 Self-hosted BTCPay ####

There are various ways to [launch a self-hosted BTCPay](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-doc#deployment). If you do not have technical knowledge, use the [web-wizard method](https://launchbtcpay.lunanode.com) and follow the video below.

For the self-hosted solutions, you will have to wait for your node to sync fully before proceeding to step 3.

#### 1.2 Third-party host ####

Those who want to test BTCPay out, or are okay with the limitations of a third-party hosting (dependency and privacy, as well as lack of some features) can use a one of many [third-party hosts](ThirdPartyHosting.md).

The video below shows you how to connect your store to such a host.

### 2. Install BTCPay WooCommerce Plugin ###

BTCPay WooCommerce plugin is a bridge between your BTCPay Server (payment processor) and your e-commerce store. No matter if you are using a self-hosted or third-party solution from step 1., the connection process is identical.

You can find detailed installation instructions on our [WooCommerce documentation](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/WooCommerce/).

Here is a quick walk through if you prefer a video:
