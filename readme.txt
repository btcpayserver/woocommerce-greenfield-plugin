BTCPay Server is a free and open-source bitcoin payment processor which allows you to receive payments in Bitcoin and altcoins directly, with no fees, transaction cost or a middleman.

== Description ==

BTCPay Server is a free and open-source cryptocurrency payment processor which allows you to receive payments in Bitcoin and altcoins directly, with no fees, transaction cost or a middleman.

BTCPay Server is a non-custodial invoicing system which eliminates the involvement of a third-party. Payments with BTCPay WooCommerce Plugin go directly to your wallet, which increases the privacy and security. Your private keys are never uploaded to the server. There is no address re-use since each invoice generates a new address deriving from your xPub key.

You can run BTCPay as a self-hosted solution on your own server, or use a third-party host.

The self-hosted solution allows you not only to attach an unlimited number of stores and use the Lightning Network but also become the payment processor for others.

* Direct, peer-to-peer Bitcoin and altcoin payments
* No transaction fees (other than mining fees by cryptocurrency network itself)
* No processing fees
* No middleman
* No KYC
* User has complete control over private keys
* Enhanced privacy (no address re-use, no IP leaks to third parties)

To integrate BTCPay Server into an existing WooCommerce store, follow the steps below or check our official [installation instructions](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/WooCommerce/).

### 1. Deploy BTCPay Server (optional) ###

This step is optional, if you already have a BTCPay Server instance setup you can skip to section 2. below. To launch your BTCPay server, you can self-host it, or use a third party host.

#### 1.1 Self-hosted BTCPay ####

There are various ways to [launch a self-hosted BTCPay](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-doc#deployment). If you do not have technical knowledge, use the [web-wizard method](https://launchbtcpay.lunanode.com) and follow the video below.

For the self-hosted solutions, you will have to wait for your node to sync fully before proceeding to step 3.

#### 1.2 Third-party host ####

Those who want to test BTCPay out, or are okay with the limitations of a third-party hosting (dependency and privacy, as well as lack of some features) can use a one of many [third-party hosts](ThirdPartyHosting.md).

The video below shows you how to connect your store to such a host.

### 2. Install BTCPay WooCommerce Plugin ###

BTCPay WooCommerce plugin is a bridge between your BTCPay Server (payment processor) and your e-commerce store. No matter if you are using a self-hosted or third-party solution from step 1., the connection process is identical.

You can find detailed installation instructions on our [WooCommerce documentation](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/WooCommerce/).

Here is a quick walk through if you prefer a video:

###  3. Connecting your wallet ###

No matter if you're using self-hosted or server hosted by a third-party, the process of configuring your wallet is the same.

### 4. Testing the checkout ###

Making a small test-purchase from your own store, will give you a piece of mind. Always make sure that everything is set up correctly before going live. The final video, guides you through the steps of setting a gap limit in your Electrum wallet and testing the checkout process.
